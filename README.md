This project focuses on implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for object detection and localization of malaria-infected cells. 
The objective is to develop a model that can accurately detect and localize the presence of malaria infection within blood cell images. 
The model utilizes convolutional layers, which are capable of learning important visual features, to identify and classify infected cells and 
determine the bounding box around the infection.
